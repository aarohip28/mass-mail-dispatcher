c) Valid Email List: It also shows a list of email addresses from the CSV file that are valid and can be used for sending emails.

3) Functionality:
a) File Upload: Users can select a CSV file from their device.
b) Email Validation: The application should perform email validation, separating valid and invalid emails.
